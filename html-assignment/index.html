  <p1>Hey professor, my name is Ronak and I am native to India. I have completed my senior secondary education in my home-country. I have choosen this program because it provides a platform for the creative expression. As I have a passion for visual arts, graphic design and animination, this field allows me to channel my creativity into Interactive digital experiences. </p1>

   <p2><br>Furthermore, since my childhood I have a keen interest in photography and baking. I adore clicking the scenic pictures of beautiful mountains,roads,rivers and plants. Moreover, there are many liesure pursuits that I really love to do like sometimes I like to play some outdoors games for instance, badminton, basketball and many more. </br></p2>
